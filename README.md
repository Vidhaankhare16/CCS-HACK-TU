Railway Track Defect Detection System -
Our railway track defect detection system is designed to enhance track inspection efficiency by utilizing a camera-based approach mounted on moving trains, particularly slower-moving cargo trains. The system employs the ArduCam OV9281 (a global shutter camera with 120 FPS) to capture high-resolution images of railway tracks in real-time. These images are then analyzed to detect visible cracks and structural defects.
